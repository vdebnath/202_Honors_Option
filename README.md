## Overview

This project sees the development of three different neural networks to help classify images from the sklearn dataset 'load_digits'. The first two models were made using NumPy and the third one was made using the Keras API from Tensorflow. The performance of each model was compared to one another and the questions of how the NumPy models compared to the Keras model and the reason for making the NumPy models were answered.
